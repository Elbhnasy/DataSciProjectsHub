#  Project: Students Performance in Exams

Aim of this project is to analyze student work as an essential part of teaching. Teachers assign, collect and examine student work all the time to assess student learning and to revise and improve teaching. Ongoing assessment of student learning allows teachers to engage in continuous quality improvement of their courses. Many factors can influence a student's performance, including the influence of the parent's educational background, test preparation, student health, and so on.

**Objectives of Notebook:**

- 📊Explore every feature in the dataset
- 🗺️Practice using libraries to visualize data
- 🐝Analyze the relationship between attributes
- 📝Find out the factors that affect the score


## Dataset

The dataset consists of one CSV file: StudentsPerformance.csv. The file contains 1000 rows and 8 columns.


## Code

The code for this project is written in Python 3 and can be found in the Students_Performance_in_Exams.ipynb file. We used several Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, to explore the data, clean it, and sklearn to build models to predict employee termination.






## Conclusion

🗺️ Some interesting things from the above analysis :
- In terms of gender:
   - The male sex ratio is more than 10% more than females, demonstrating the current gender imbalance
   - Males tend to do better in math than female
   - Females tend to do better at reading and writing than male
- In terms of race/ethnicity:
   - No discernible effect
   - Group E tends to have higher scores than other groups
- In terms of lunch (standard, free/reduced):
   - The ratio of the free/reduced lunch option is much higher than the standard lunch option
   - Standard lunch options tend to have higher scores than the free/reduced
- In terms of test preparation courses (completed/none):
   - The number of students who did not take the exam preparation course was more than the number of students who completed the course
   - The number of students who completed the test preparation course tended to have higher scores than those who did not
- In terms of parental level of education :
   - Parents' education level did not have much effect on students' test scores
