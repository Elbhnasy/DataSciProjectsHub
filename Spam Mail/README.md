# Project Spam Mail 

This project aims to build a model that can predict whether this mail is spam or not

## Notebook Objectives
1.📊Explore each column's distribution in the dataset
2.📉Analysis of ham messages
3.📈Analysis of spam messages
4.0️⃣1️⃣Classification with ML Models LogisticRegression

## About Dataset

- The dataset 'Spam Email' contains 2 columns, each is:
   - Category: Whether it is spam or ham
   - Message: the context of the message
## Code

The code for this project is written in Python 3 and can be found in the Stroke_Prediction.ipynb file. We used several Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, to explore the data, clean it, and sklearn to build models to predict employee termination.
