#  Project: Employee Termination Predictor

This project aims to identify employees who are likely to be terminated based on a set of features such as marital status, employment status, department, performance score, recruitment source, and others.

The data consists of information about employees, including their personal information, job details, and performance metrics. The dataset also contains information on whether an employee has been terminated or not.

**The questions that we will try to answer in this project are:**

1. Is there any relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?
2. What are our best recruiting sources if we want to ensure a diverse organization?
3. Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
4. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?


## Dataset

The dataset consists of one CSV file: HRDataset_v14.csv. The file contains 3,149 rows and 36 columns.


## Code

The code for this project is written in Python 3 and can be found in the code.ipynb file. We used several Python libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, to explore the data, clean it, and sklearn to build models to predict employee termination.


## Power PI

Power PI is a business analytics service that we used to visualize and analyze the employee termination dataset. We created interactive visualizations such as charts and graphs to identify patterns and trends in the data, and the Power PI report is available in the Human Resource Dashboard.pbix file. By using Power PI, we were able to create visually appealing and informative reports that provide valuable insights into the data and can help businesses make informed decisions.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the factors that contribute to employee termination and identifies areas of the company where improvements can be made. By understanding these factors, the company can take proactive measures to improve employee satisfaction and retention.
